1. Evenly distrbute the slips of paper being handed out by the instructor and TAs.
1. Enter your lyrics into the `lyrics.txt` file, add, commit, and push them to the repo on github.
1. **Only after** everyone has pushed their lyrics. Take a look at the original [lyrics](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/Code_Monkey/Lyrics).
